        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>

     <li>HTML "hypertext markup language": gives the content structure. </li>
     <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
     <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
     <li>Elements that are nested inside other elements are called child elements and the element that holds all the children, is known as the parent element.</li>
     <li>In Semantic HTML elements, the name of the elements describes it's content and the role it plays on a webpage. Not all elements are semantic though.</li>
     <li>Section elements are semantic elements that define a section in a document that contains thematic content.</li>
     <li>An element refers to the entire element from opening tag to closing tag.</li>
     <li>A tag refers only to what appears inside the angle brackets.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>

          <li>CSS defines the colors, aethetics, visual layout and organization.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>3 ways to style a webpage using CSS: Inline CSS, Internal CSS style sheet and External CSS style sheet.</li>
          <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations will apply.</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: The CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>
          <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rules to a class attribute with a class selector.</li>
          <li>Do Not Repeat Yourself "DRY" is a coding principle that encourages developers to reuse or share pieces of code in order to reduce the number of lines of code that need to be written or maintained.</li>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>

    <li>Git is a verson control software and GitHub is a cloud-based service that hosts our repositories.</li>
    <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on.</li>
    <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it.</li>
    <li>git add -A: commits all files in the current working branch and adds modifications to the staging area.</li>
    <li>git commit -m "commit message": commits the files.</li>
    <li>Always do a git pull to make sure that you have the latest version of the project on your local computer before you start to work.</li>
    <li>git push: pushes the changes we have locally to our remote GitHub branch.</li>
    <li>A branch is a copy or version of the code that can be worked on independently in isolation so development changes do not disrupt other team members who are also working on the code and testing their solutions.</li>

      <section class="card" id="javascript-section">
        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>

          <li>JavaScript is a high dynamic programing language that allows users to interact with websites.</li>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script, however, using conditional statement, allows us to interrupt control flow.</li>
          <li>The const keyword allows us to create variables that can't be reassigned a value. It "locks down" what that variable will be. </li>
          <li> An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data, such as, strings, numbers, and so on.</li>
          <li> Array index: to work with individual data items inside an array.</li>
          <li> A 'for' loop uses predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
          <li>A function is a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task.</li>
          <li>2 requirements for a JavaScript function: define the function and call the function.</li>
